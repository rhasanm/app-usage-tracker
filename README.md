# App Usage Tracker

## Overview

The App Usage Tracker is a lightweight application designed to monitor and record the duration of application usage on Windows. It captures the active window titles and their respective usage times, storing this data in a SQLite database. The application also provides visualizations of usage statistics through bar graphs.

## Features

- Tracks the duration of applications in use.
- Stores usage data in a SQLite database.
- Visualizes application usage over time with graphical output.
- Supports data retrieval for filtering by date.
- Runs as a background service for continuous monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming language installed. Follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- SQLite library for Rust. This can be added to your project using Cargo.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/app-usage-tracker.git
   cd app-usage-tracker
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   target/release/app-usage-tracker.exe --install
   ```

   This command installs the application as a service.

### Usage

- The application runs in the background, tracking active window titles and their durations.
- Use the following commands to manage the service:

  ```bash
  target/release/app-usage-tracker.exe --start    # Start the service
  target/release/app-usage-tracker.exe --stop     # Stop the service
  target/release/app-usage-tracker.exe --delete   # Delete the service
  target/release/app-usage-tracker.exe --status    # Check the service status
  ```

- To visualize usage data, run:

  ```bash
  target/release/app-usage-tracker.exe --draw-graph
  ```

  This will generate a `usage_graph.png` file showing application usage over time.

## Database Structure

The application uses an SQLite database with the following table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_usage (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    task TEXT NOT NULL,
    app_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
    usage_date DATE NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(task, app_name, usage_date) -- Ensure unique entries based on task, app_name, and date
);
```
